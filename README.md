# Welcome To @safelytyped/ip-port!

## Introduction

This library provides a safe `IpPort` type, and supporting helper functions.

## Quick Start

```
# run this from your Terminal
npm install @safelytyped/ip-port
```

```typescript
// add this import to your Typescript code
import { IpPort } from "@safelytyped/ip-port"
```

__VS Code users:__ once you've added a single import anywhere in your project, you'll then be able to auto-import anything else that this library exports.
